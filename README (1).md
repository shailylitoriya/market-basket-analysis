### Items Sold Over Time (Monthly)

![Items Sold Over Time(Daily)](images/itemsSoldMonthly.png)

Shows seasonality and customer's shopping behavoiur over the months of the year.

---
###  Basket Size Distribution

![Basket Size](images/basket_size_distribution.png)

Most baskets contain **2 to 3 items**, indicating that shoppers often make small purchases.

---

## Frequent Pattern Mining

- **Algorithm:** Apriori
- **Min Support:** 0.005
- **Min Confidence:** 0.1

### Top Frequent Itemsets

| Items                  | Support |
|------------------------|---------|
| Whole milk             | 15.79%  |
| Other vegetables       | 12.21%  |
| Rolls/buns             | 11.00%  |
| Soda                   | 9.71%   |
| Yogurt                 | 8.59%   |

## Association Rules

| Antecedent        | Consequent     | Confidence | Lift     |
|-------------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| Bottled beer      | Whole milk     | 15.78%     | 0.999    |
| Sausage           | Whole milk     | 14.84%     | 0.939    |
| Newspapers        | Whole milk     | 14.43%     | 0.913    |
| Frankfurter       | Whole milk     | 13.98%     | 0.885    |
| Frankfurter       | Vegetables     | 13.62%     | 1.116    |

These rules show **complementary item relationships**, helping retailers with bundling and shelf organization.

###  Support vs Confidence Plot

![Support vs Confidence](images/supportVSconfidence.png)

This scatter plot visualizes how strong rules (high confidence and lift) are distributed in terms of support.

---

## Key Insights

- **Whole milk** frequently co-occurs with many other items and appears in the majority of high-confidence rules.
- **Small baskets dominate**, with most transactions containing only a few items.
- **Lift < 1** in many rules implies weak or negative correlations, but some high-lift rules (like frankfurter â†’ vegetables) are actionable.
- The model can help **optimize product placement** and develop **targeted promotions** based on item associations.
